Atmel AVR helpers for Ghidra
============================

Contents include:
* Processor definitions for ATmega328p processor
* Manual index for Atmel AVR Instruction Set Manual
* Ghidra script to place short instruction descriptions as EOL comments over
  selected program region
* Modifications to AVR8 SLEIGH specification and gcc compiler specs

Will attempt to push processor definitions and manual index upstream when
source code is released.
